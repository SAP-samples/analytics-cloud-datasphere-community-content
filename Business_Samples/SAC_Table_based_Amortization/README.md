## What´s New
The Table_based_Amortization content package contains classic stories or classic analytical applications.
As explained in this [blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/important-notice-changes-in-sap-analytics-cloud-classic-stories-amp/ba-p/13705220), it will no longer be supported to import this content package starting with 2024 Q4 QRC for new tenants only, as it contains Classic Stories or Analytic Applications.
Once the SAP Analytics Cloud Classic Experience for Stories and Analytic Applications will no longer be supported in general, this package will be deprecated (current planning: 2025 Q2 QRC).
