This demo shows how a BestRun Business User can quickly and easily combine and analyze data coming from different sources in SAP Datasphere using SAP Analytics Cloud as the visualization.

BestRun is interested in a Cloud enabled Data Warehouse and Analytics solution in which Business Users find one unified User Experience. Business Users themselves want to be able to quickly combine their data from different sources into structures on which they can deliver and share end user reporting in a fast way.
