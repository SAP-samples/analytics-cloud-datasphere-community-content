This demo shows how a BestRun Business User can quickly and easily combine and analyze data coming from different sources in SAP Datasphere using SAP Analytics Cloud as the visualization.

BestRun is interested in a Cloud enabled Data Warehouse and Analytics solution in which Business Users find one unified User Experience.
