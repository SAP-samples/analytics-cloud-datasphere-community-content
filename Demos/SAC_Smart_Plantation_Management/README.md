## Descripton
 
Business Challenge:
There are many aspects involved in the process of maintaining sizeable plantations. This solution optimizes the deployment of labor for fertilizing and harvesting those crops, while tracking the operations across all varying parties involved in that process. Decision makers can refer to a dashboard for clear actionable insights and automated guidance on how to run their plantations with increased efficiency and efficacy. These capabilities can enable a modern plantation operationâ€” putting aerial drones, IoT sensors and AI algorithms at work to monitor the health of the vast plantations across large regions.

Solution:
SAP Analytics Cloud would give Plantation Managers a high-level overview of plantation health and would send alerts for any issues that arise in real time. We can stitch images captured by the aerial drones together using SAP HANA spatial services, and run them through deep learning models that recognize typical crop, leaf and shoot diseases like wilting or cankering. If a potential problem is identified, the Plantation Manager can connect its exact geo-spatial location to the Agronomist for them to directly attend the situation. After which, the Agronomist would send a request to the Field Manager for pesticide application via the mobile app, where the amount of pesticide and number of workers utilized would be recorded by the Field Manager upon completion of the task.
