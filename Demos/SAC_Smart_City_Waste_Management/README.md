## Descripton
Business Challenge:

IoT devices installed on trash cans record data like fill level, segregation rate, temperature. etc. On garbage trucks, these sensors send out location and fill level details. These disparate pieces of information need to be stitched together by a system that allows decision makers to view the current status of waste management in Smart Cities to design optimal routes for garbage trucks based on fill levels of trash cans across the island of Singapore. We translated that overview of data onto a dashboard to allow users to take actionable steps towards optimizing waste management processes. While page filters allow analysis within a page, story filters can also be applied so analysis in a certain page can be carried forward to other pages of the story. Some of SAP Analytic Cloud peers in the market do not allow this flexibility.

Solution:

We built an interactive dashboard in SAP Analytics Cloud by loading a prototype of representative data from local files. The dashboards provide an overview of city-wide waste management using KPIs like fill levels, route completion and waste collection. See how much our carbon footprint from all activities pursued is, how much waste we are able to segregate with automated systems, how much electricity is generated from waste recycling units and how much waste is sequestered by the hour— Singapore incinerates waste in a landfill on an island off our coast called Pulau Semakau and these incineration plants generate electricity but are also heavy carbon emitters. We can also estimate monthly revenue from reselling of recycled waste, and how much waste is generated by the hour to give us average waste levels. Data can also be sliced by regions & districts of Singapore, bin types (plastic, organic or paper) and snapshots. Lastly, we can track individual garbage trucks as they make their way through the city on their customized routes and receive notifications on any incidents that occur automatically.
